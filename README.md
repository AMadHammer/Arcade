# Arcade

  This is a simple node application to get around the pain of not being able to load files on the drive (Browser security issue). To make a game, simply make a folder like the astroid one and follow the format of how the files are added.
  

# TODO milestones by importance:
- 2-4 players. (get controller working for player one.)
- random UFO shooting around (might be ignored because ... they such tbh and other enemies can be added later)

Finished:
- Full screen support
- Controller support (chrome for now)
- allow game to start with no controllers
- fix bug with full screen
- high score screen (ignored because it is not important to the main game enjoyment. I don't wanna beat my own score)


# DONE 
- Full screen support
- Controller support (chrome for now)
