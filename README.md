  This is a simple node application to get around the pain of not being able to load files on the drive (Browser security issue). To make a game, simply make a folder like the astroid one and follow the format of how the files are added.
  

# TODO branches:
- Controller support
- 2-4 players. (Why not more?)
- random UFO shooting around

# DONE
