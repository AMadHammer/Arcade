# Arcade

  This is a simple node application to get around the pain of not being able to load files on the drive (Browser security issue). To make a game, simply make a folder like the astroid one and follow the format of how the files are added.
  

# TODO branches for Asteroid:
- high score screen
- allow game to start with no controllers
- random UFO shooting around
- 2-4 players. (Why not more?)

Debt items:
- refactor all globals to one file
- refactor gamepad code to it's own file
- Add more text to debug mode


# DONE 
- Full screen support
- Controller support (chrome for now)
